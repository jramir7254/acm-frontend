Several high‑level conclusions emerge from the survey results:


1. **Moderate ability to distinguish AI from human work:** Participants 
correctly classified about 60 % of the assignment versions, with accuracy 
varying widely by version (from 50 % to \~71 %). This suggests people can 
sometimes tell AI‑generated writing from human work, but the cues are 
inconsistent and often unreliable.



2. **Language and tone are key cues:** Responses indicate participants 
tended to associate AI assignments with rigid structure, repetitive phrasing 
nd formal language, while human work was recognised through conversational 
tone, personal anecdotes and local references. Overly polished or formulaic 
wording often signalled AI.



3. **Mixed preferences for assignment versions:** Preferences for assignment 
A or B were evenly split on some tasks and leaned toward one version on 
others, implying that quality differences were not stark. Participants may 
value different aspects (clarity, creativity, relevance) differently across assignments.



4. **Local context is valued but not universally:** A majority (14 of 24) 
felt including local context improved engagement, yet a sizable minority (5) 
disagreed and 5 were undecided. The average engagement rating (mean 3.5 on a 1‑5 scale) 
shows moderate enthusiasm.



5. **Desired features emphasise interactivity and relevance:** The most requested 
features for more engaging assignments were video games, career themes, creative 
freedom and local context. Traditional elements like cultural identity or group 
work received fewer votes. This implies learners crave interactive, personally 
relevant tasks that connect to their interests and future goals.



Overall, the results suggest assignments should combine authentic language, relatable 
examples and interactive elements to enhance engagement. While AI can produce competent
 tasks, incorporating human touches and context appears important for maintaining interest 
 and authenticity.
